# EDF6: Anti-Air Vehicles Must Actually Anti-Air

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

The stock KG6 Kepler is EDF6's anti-air vehicle, yet it fires slow, non-exploding rounds that
mostly miss anything flying, with half the durability of a same-level tank. This mod makes it do
its job, and turns the DLC KG7 Bohr into a self-aiming ground-attack launcher.

It has two parts:

- **EDF6AutoTurret.dll**, an [EDFModLoader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDFModLoader) plugin. The
  turret aims itself: it picks targets from the game's own enemy list, leads them, solves the
  round's ballistic arc and drives the turret with feed-forward so rounds stop trailing crossing
  targets. Flak rounds get a time fuse at the target's range, a proximity fuse and a contact fuse.
  Hold the aim stick to aim by hand; let go and the turret takes over again.
  It also crews the **side guns of the Titan and of the Ranger's gunner-seat tanks**: an empty
  gunner seat (or one an NPC sits in) aims and fires its gun by itself, on player- and NPC-driven
  tanks alike; a player in a gunner seat gets the auto-aim and keeps the trigger. This part needs
  no weapon files and works on the stock vehicles.
- **Weapon data** overriding the stock vehicles' own files. No weapon rows are added. The
  vehicles' descriptions in `WEAPONTEXT` are rewritten with the new numbers; only their own rows
  change, on top of whatever tables are already in `Mods`, so mods that edit the tables keep theirs.

## What changes

| Vehicle | Change |
|---|---|
| KG6 Kepler, E, F, YE, YF | Flak: exploding rounds (8 m blast), proximity / time / contact fuses, 480 m range. Half the fire rate at twice the damage per round (same damage per second on paper, half the bursts on screen). Durability x2. DLC YF-HV turret speed. Air targets first. |
| Keplers the missions place (NPC-crewed, and the boardable mission ones) | The modded KG6 Kepler: its flak guns (in place of the NPC Keplers' own 1-damage guns), durability x2 on top of the mission's own multiplier, the fast turret. |
| KG6 Kepler YF-HV (DLC) | Auto-aim only; keeps its high-velocity solid shot, durability and turret. |
| KG7 Bohr, Bohr B (DLC) | Auto-aim in ground mode: ground targets first, lobbed rounds aimed on their arc, stock impact fuse. Durability x2, blast 4 m -> 6 m, and the blasts now wreck buildings. |
| Titan (all, incl. DLC side cannons) | Plugin only: both side cannons aim themselves; with no player in a gunner seat they also fire, as the driver's (player or NPC). Main cannon untouched. |
| NPC Titan (e.g. mission 64) | Optional data (`tools/titan_ai.py`): the stock NPC Titan has empty side-cannon mounts; this gives it the player Titan's two side cannons, which the plugin then aims and fires. |
| Ranger tanks with gunner seats (Vehicle403) | Plugin only: both side machine guns, as above. Single-seat tanks (Air Raider's, Vehicle601) have no side guns. |

Why: the stock Keplers deal a third to a half of the damage per second of same-level tanks and
helicopters, with under half their durability, and the shortest range of any of them. The Bohr
already out-damages the same-level Barrias TZ4 but has well under half its durability.

## Install

Requires EDF6 (Steam) with [EDFModLoader](https://github.com/BlueAmulet/EDFModLoader) installed.

1. Copy `EDF6AutoTurret.dll` and `EDF6AutoTurret.ini` from a release (or a CI build artifact) into
   `<EDF6>\Mods\Plugins\`.
2. Build the weapon files from your own game data (they are derived from it, so they are not
   distributed) with Python 3.10+, straight into the game's `Mods` folder:

   ```
   set EDF6_DIR=C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 6
   python tools\build.py --out "%EDF6_DIR%\Mods"
   ```

   It writes the vehicles' own call and gun files under `Mods\WEAPON\`, the mission Keplers under
   `Mods\OBJECT\`, and their eight rows of
   the `WEAPONTEXT.*.SGO` tables there; it reads the game's `Root.cpk` and never modifies it. Run it
   while the game is closed, and again after installing another mod that replaces `WEAPONTEXT`.
   `--no-text` leaves the text tables alone.
3. Optional, the NPC Titan's side cannons: `python tools\titan_ai.py` writes
   `dist\Mods\OBJECT\VEHICLE404_BIGTANK_AI.SGO`; copy it to `<EDF6>\Mods\OBJECT\`.

To uninstall, delete those files and the plugin (delete the `WEAPONTEXT` files only if no other
mod installed them; otherwise reinstall that mod's). Settings are in `EDF6AutoTurret.ini` and apply
while the game runs; `Debug=1` writes what the turret is doing to `EDF6AutoTurret.log`.

## Build the plugin

Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ x64 tools (CMake and Ninja come with it):

```
build.cmd
```

The DLL lands in `dist\Mods\Plugins\`. CI builds it on every push.

## Compatibility

Built against EDF.dll with TimeDateStamp `0x678CCB46`. The plugin checks the code it patches and
turns itself off if the game has changed.

The tank gunners were tested on the Titan (NPC driver, both gunner seats empty): both side
cannons fired at ants, 40 -> 28 rounds. The Ranger tanks' side guns have not been tested against
live enemies yet; send a `Debug=1` log if a side gun misbehaves. The stock game leaves an empty
gunner seat's gun silent because the gun asks the vehicle who operates it and an empty seat answers
no one; the plugin answers with the driver (see the re-notes). The input hooks chain onto whatever
another plugin (e.g. EDF6VehicleCrew) put in the same slot, so load order does not matter. In co-op, a remote
player in a gunner seat may look like an empty seat to your machine, so set `GunnerAI=0` online.

Online play is untested. The mod adds no weapon rows, so players without it never meet a row they
do not have; but each machine simulates the vehicles from its own files, so in a mixed lobby the
Keplers will not behave the same for everyone. Have every player install it. Reverse-engineering notes: [docs/re-notes.md](docs/re-notes.md).
